The aim of this report is to research whether a visible light-based solution is viable alternative for detecting and tracking drones. Due to geometric and other practical considerations, the target is a plane and reflective piece of aluminium foil. The objective of this exercise is to create a proof of concept primarily composed of a laser attached to a galvanometer, Raspberry pi and camera feedback. The scope of this project is limited to short-range detection in controlled indoor conditions. 

This repo is based on the report:  Visible laser and camera based targeting of drones, Christian Nielsen, Jan 2026. 

In this repo, you can find the Raspberry Pi code + main PC code + Ethernet setup guide for Raspberry + mainPC. You can also find videos and photos of the experiment.
